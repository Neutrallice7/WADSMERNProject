# LocaGO Project

## ABOUT
Welcome to LocaGO, a location travel sharing web application created with the MERN stack. We want to connect travelers from all over the world by making it easier to share places, experiences, and thoughts. We want to provide a platform where users can learn about new locations, conveniently organize their travels, and communicate with other travelers from across the world about their experiences.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
LocaGO is powered by the MERN Stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React.JS, and Node.js. Each of these technologies is integral to our application, contributing to its functionality, scalability, and user experience.

* **MongoDB:** The project's database management system. With the flexibility and scalability that MongoDB provides, we're able to efficiently manage and store data in a format similar to JSON.
* **Express:** This Node.js framework makes server-side operations simpler. Express.js makes it easier for us to build reliable HTTP servers as it offers a wide range of functionality
* **React.js:** The JavaScript library we use for creating user interfaces. React.js allows us to build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
* **Node.js:**  Our chosen JavaScript runtime. Node.js allows us to execute JavaScript code server-side, providing a cohesive and unified JavaScript development stack.
